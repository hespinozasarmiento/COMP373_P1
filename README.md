# COMP373_P1
Project 1: Facility Management System Design and Implementation

# Getting Started
In this project, we will start providing an object domain model for Facility Management System by addressing the design and implementation using OOP.  The aim is to have a domain model that is designed using OOP that will be used to study Object relationship and Dependency.

# WHAT IS BEING INDENTIFIED IN THIS PROJECT?

•	Identify the main entitles of the problem domain.

•	Identify their attributes.

•	Identify their relationships.

•	Identify their roles and responsibilities.

•	Discover other objects that facilitate implementing responsibilities.

•	Make available all client interfaces/services specified in the specification document (Facility, Facility Use, and Facility Maintenance Client Interfaces).

# ISSUES 

After designing the UML model, we were unable to figure out the SQL connection to our database. For that reason, the client view is not fully functional. However, the code runs. The UML and our code show the plan we wanted to follow, but we unable to because of the complications we encountered.
